# Rock Paper Scissors

A classic rock paper scissors game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows players to choose their move and see the result of the match against the computer's randomly chosen move.

In addition to the core gameplay, this project also includes:

- A score board that keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for the player and computer
- A reset button to start a new game

While working on this project, I had the opportunity to:

- Practice implementing user input and event handling with JavaScript
- Use CSS transitions and transformations to add visual flair to the game
- Write clean and organized code using best practices

Try out the game by cloning the repository and opening the `index.html` file in your web browser. See if you can outsmart the computer and emerge victorious in this timeless game of strategy.
